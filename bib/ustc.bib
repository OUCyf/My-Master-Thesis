abstract = {We construct a coseismic deformation interferogram for the April 2010 Yushu earthquakes using ALOS/PALSAR data from the ascending track (path 487).We then infer the trace of the Yushu fault using the coherence image, and we build five fault models for the Yushu fault. To determine the fault geometry parameters that give the best fit to the coseismic interferogram, we apply an elastic dislocation algorithm. Our preferred fault model consists of two faults dipping to the northeast. One strikes $\sim$N60°W with a dip of 82°; the other strikes $\sim$N67°W with a dip of 86°. Lastly, we infer the coseismic slip distributions of the Yushu earthquakes by the inversion of the displacement in the line of sight (LOS). The results show that three high-slip concentrations are located at a depth of 5 $\sim$ 8 km, with a peak slip of 1.32 m at (96.93 E, 33.03 N). The Yushu fault is a left-lateral strike-slip faulting with small northside-up, dip-slip components.},

abstract = {Although ring faults are present at many ancient, deeply eroded volcanoes, they have been detected at only very few modern volcanic centers. At the so far little studied Tend{\"{u}}rek volcano in eastern Turkey, we generated an ascending and a descending InSAR time series of its surface displacement field for the period from 2003 to 2010. We detected a large (∼105 km2) region that underwent subsidence at the rate of ∼1 cm/yr during this period. Source modeling results show that the observed signal fits best to simulations of a near-horizontal contracting sill located at around 4.5 km below the volcano summit. Intriguingly, the residual displacement velocity field contains a steep gradient that systematically follows a system of arcuate fractures visible on the volcano's midflanks. RapidEye satellite optical images show that this fracture system has deflected Holocene lava flows, thus indicating its presence for at least several millennia. We interpret the arcuate fracture system as the surface expression of an inherited ring fault that has been slowly reactivated during the detected recent subsidence. These results show that volcano ring faults may not only slip rapidly during eruptive or intrusive phases, but also slowly during dormant phases. {\textcopyright} 2013. American Geophysical Union.

abstract = {The Bayesian earthquake analysis tool (BEAT) is an open-source Python software to conduct source-parameter estimation studies for crustal deformation events, such as earthquakes and magma intrusions, by employing a Bayesian framework with a flexible problem definition. The software features functionality to calculate Green's functions for a homogeneous or a layered elastic half-space. Furthermore, algorithm(s) that explore the solution space may be selected from a suite of implemented samplers. If desired, BEAT's modular architecture allows for easy implementation of additional features, for example, alternative sampling algorithms. We demonstrate the functionality and performance of the package using five earthquake source estimation examples: a full moment-tensor estimation; a double-couple moment-tensor estimation; an estimation for a rectangular finite source; a static finite-fault estimation with variable slip; and a full kinematic finite-fault estimation with variable hypocenter location, rupture velocity, and rupture duration. This software integrates many aspects of source studies and provides an extensive framework for joint use of geodetic and seismic data for nonlinear source- and noise-covariance estimation within layered elastic half-spaces. Furthermore, the software also provides an open platform for further methodological development and for reproducible source studies in the geophysical community.},

@article{Ellsworth2013,
abstract = {### Background Human-induced earthquakes have become an important topic of political and scientific discussion, owing to the concern that these events may be responsible for widespread damage and an overall increase in seismicity. It has long been known that impoundment of reservoirs, surface and underground mining, withdrawal of fluids and gas from the subsurface, and injection of fluids into underground formations are capable of inducing earthquakes. In particular, earthquakes caused by injection have become a focal point, as new drilling and well-completion technologies enable the extraction of oil and gas from previously unproductive formations. ![Graphic][1]</img> Earthquakes with magnitude (M) ≥ 3 in the U.S. midcontinent, 1967–2012. After decades of a steady earthquake rate (average of 21 events/year), activity increased starting in 2001 and peaked at 188 earthquakes in 2011. Human-induced earthquakes are suspected to be partially responsible for the increase. ### Advances Microearthquakes (that is, those with magnitudes below 2) are routinely produced as part of the hydraulic fracturing (or “fracking”) process used to stimulate the production of oil, but the process as currently practiced appears to pose a low risk of inducing destructive earthquakes. More than 100,000 wells have been subjected to fracking in recent years, and the largest induced earthquake was magnitude 3.6, which is too small to pose a serious risk. Yet, wastewater disposal by injection into deep wells poses a higher risk, because this practice can induce larger earthquakes. For example, several of the largest earthquakes in the U.S. midcontinent in 2011 and 2012 may have been triggered by nearby disposal wells. The largest of these was a magnitude 5.6 event in central Oklahoma that destroyed 14 homes and injured two people. The mechanism responsible for inducing these events appears to be the well-understood process of weakening a preexisting fault by elevating the fluid pressure. However, only a small fraction of the more than 30,000 wastewater disposal wells appears to be problematic—typically those that dispose of very large volumes of water and/or communicate pressure perturbations directly into basement faults. ### Outlook Injection-induced earthquakes, such as those that struck in 2011, clearly contribute to the seismic hazard. Quantifying their contribution presents difficult challenges that will require new research into the physics of induced earthquakes and the potential for inducing large-magnitude events. The petroleum industry needs clear requirements for operation, regulators must have a solid scientific basis for those requirements, and the public needs assurance that the regulations are sufficient and are being followed. The current regulatory frameworks for wastewater disposal wells were designed to protect potable water sources from contamination and do not address seismic safety. One consequence is that both the quantity and timeliness of information on injection volumes and pressures reported to regulatory agencies are far from ideal for managing earthquake risk from injection activities. In addition, seismic monitoring capabilities in many of the areas in which wastewater injection activities have increased are not capable of detecting small earthquake activity that may presage larger seismic events. We tend to view earthquakes as unpredictable phenomena caused by naturally shifting stresses in Earth's crust. In reality, however, a range of human activity can also induce earthquakes. Ellsworth (p. [10.1126/science.1225942][2]) reviews the current understanding of the causes and mechanics of earthquakes caused by human activity and the means to decrease their associated risk. Notable examples include injection of wastewater into deep formations and emerging technologies related to oil and gas recovery, including hydraulic fracturing. In addition to directly causing increased local seismic activity, activities such as deep fluid injection may have other ramifications related to earthquake occurrence. Van der Elst et al. (p. [164][3]; see the news story by [Kerr][4] ) demonstrate that in the midwestern United States, some areas with increased human-induced seismicity are also more prone to further earthquakes triggered by the seismic waves from large, remote earthquakes. Improved seismic monitoring and injection data near deep disposal sites will help to identify regions prone to remote triggering and, more broadly, suggest times when activities should, at least temporarily, be put on hold. Earthquakes in unusual locations have become an important topic of discussion in both North America and Europe, owing to the concern that industrial activity could cause damaging earthquakes. It has long been understood that earthquakes can be induced by impoundment of reservoirs, surface and underground mining, withdrawal of fluids and gas from the subsurface, and injection of fluids into underground formations. Injection-induced earthquakes have, in particular, become a focus of discussion as the application of hydraulic fracturing to tight shale formations is enabling the production of oil and gas from previously unproductive formations. Earthquakes can be induced as part of the process to stimulate the production from tight shale formations, or by disposal of wastewater associated with stimulation and production. Here, I review recent seismic activity that may be associated with industrial activity, with a focus on the disposal of wastewater by injection in deep wells; assess the scientific understanding of induced earthquakes; and discuss the key scientific challenges to be met for assessing this hazard.

@article{Lei2017,
abstract = {This paper presents a timely and detailed study of significant injection-induced seismicity recently observed in the Sichuan Basin, China, where shale-gas hydraulic fracturing has been initiated and the aggressive production of shale gas is planned for the coming years. Multiple lines of evidence, including an epidemic-type aftershock sequence model, relocated hypocenters, the mechanisms of 13 large events (MW > 3.5), and numerically calculated Coulomb failure stress results, convincingly suggest that a series of earthquakes with moment magnitudes up to MW 4.7 has been induced by “short-term” (several months at a single well pad) injections for hydraulic fracturing at depths of 2.3 to 3 km. This, in turn, supports the hypothesis that they represent examples of injection-induced fault reactivation. The geologic reasons why earthquake magnitudes associated with hydraulic fracturing operations are so high in this area are discussed. Because hydraulic fracturing operations are on the rise in the Sichuan Basin, it would be beneficial for the geoscience, gas operator, regulator, and academic communities to work collectively to elucidate the local factors governing the high level of injection-induced seismicity, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that shale gas fracking can be carried out effectively and safely.},

abstract = {Induced seismicity associated with energy production is becoming an increasingly important issue worldwide for the hazard it poses to the exposed population and structures. We analyze one of the rare cases of induced seismicity associated with the underwater gas storage operations observed in the Castor platform, located in the Valencia gulf, east Spain, near a complex and important geological structure. In September 2013, some gas injection operations started at Castor, producing a series of seismic events around the reservoir area. The larger magnitude events (up to 4.2) took place some days after the end of the injection, with EMS intensities in coastal towns up to degree III. In this work, the seismic sequence is analyzed with the aim of detecting changes in statistical parameters describing the earthquake occurrence before and after the injection and identifying possible proxies to be used for monitoring the sequence evolution. Moreover, we explore the potential predictability of these statistical parameters which can be used to control the field operations in injection/storage fluid reservoirs. We firstly perform a retrospective approach and next a perspective analysis. We use different techniques for estimating the value of the expected maximum magnitude that can occur due to antropogenic activities in Castor.},

We determined the landslide force history from long-period seismic waves and identified eight subevents. For each subevent, we obtained an independent force history and calculated its sliding path. The shape of the terrain before and after the landslide was found to play a critical role in the motion of the sliding mass. A combination of seismic and terrain data was used to discriminate between or relate the subevents to each other, and to locate the initiation point of each sliding path. We explain the Maoxian landslide dynamics as the combination of the rock collapse, centripetal acceleration of the sliding body, deceleration and acceleration once again after overcoming obstacles along the sliding path.},

abstract = {We introduce a new method for determining earthquake focal mechanisms from P-wave first-motion polarities. Our technique differs from previous methods in that it accounts for possible errors in the assumed earthquake location and seismic-velocity model, as well as in the polarity observations. The set of acceptable focal mechanisms, allowing for the expected errors in polarities and takeoff angles, is found for each event. Multiple trials are performed with different source locations and velocity models, and mechanisms with up to a specified fraction of misfit polarities are included in the set of acceptable mechanisms. The average of the set is returned as the preferred mechanism, and the uncertainty is represented by the distribution of acceptable mechanisms. The solution is considered adequately stable only if the set of acceptable mechanisms is tightly clustered around the preferred mechanism. We validate the method by demonstrating that the well-constrained mechanisms found for clusters of closely spaced events with similar waveforms are indeed very similar. Tests on noisy synthetic data, which mimic the event and station coverage of real data, show that the method accurately recovers the mechanisms and that the uncertainty estimates are reasonable. We also investigate the sensitivity of focal mechanisms to changes in polarities, event depth, and seismic-velocity model, and we find that mechanisms are most sensitive to changes in the vertical velocity gradient.},

The observed S/P ratios are generally consistent with the expected mechanisms, implying that S/P ratios can in fact be useful in constraining the focal mechanisms of small events. However, we also find that noise in the observations leads to scatter in the S/P ratios of factors of 2, and sometimes higher. This scatter limits the usefulness of the S/P ratios in two ways: (1) the focal mechanism cannot simply be fit to S/P amplitude data alone without accounting for the noise in a more sophisticated focal mechanism inversion process; (2) while the amplitude ratios may improve poorly constrained mechanisms, they are less useful in refining solutions that are already relatively well constrained.},

Thus two classical problems of seismology are combined into a single procedure. Given an estimate of the origin time, epicentral coordinates and depth, an initial moment tensor is derived using one of the variations of the method described in detail by Gilbert and Dziewonski (1975). This set of parameters represents the starting values for an iterative procedure in which perturbations to the elements of the moment tensor are found simultaneously with changes in the hypocentral parameters. In general, the method is stable, and convergence rapid.

abstract = {Induced seismicity is widely detected during hydraulic fracture stimulation and oil/gas development. To better understand how seismic events are induced, a thorough knowledge of the source mechanism is required. In this study, we have developed a new method to determine the focal mechanism for induced seismicity. Three misfit functions are used in our method to measure the differences between observed and modelled data from different aspects, including the waveform, P-wave polarity and S/P amplitude ratio. We minimize these misfit functions simultaneously using the neighbourhood algorithm. Through synthetic data tests, we show the ability of our method to yield reliable focal mechanism solutions and study the effect of velocity inaccuracy and location error on the solutions. To mitigate the impact of the source location uncertainties, we develop a joint inversion method to find the optimal source depth and focal mechanism simultaneously. Using the proposed method, we have determined the focal mechanisms of 40 induced seismic events in an oil/gas field in Oman. By investigating the results, we find that the reactivation of pre-existing faults is the main cause of the induced seismicity in the monitored area. Other observations obtained from the focal mechanism solutions are also consistent with earlier studies in the same area.},

abstract = {We present a new method using high-frequency full waveform information to determine the focal mechanisms of small, local earthquakes monitored by a sparse surface network. During the waveform inversion, we maximize both the phase and amplitude matching between the observed and modelled waveforms. In addition, we use the polarities of the first P-wave arrivals and the average S/P amplitude ratios to better constrain the matching. An objective function is constructed to include all four criteria. An optimized grid search method is used to search over all possible ranges of source parameters (strike, dip and rake). To speed up the algorithm, a library of Green's functions is pre-calculated for each of the moment tensor components and possible earthquake locations. Optimizations in filtering and cross correlation are performed to further speed the grid search algorithm. The new method is tested on a five-station surface network used for monitoring induced seismicity at a petroleum field. The synthetic test showed that our method is robust and efficient to determine the focal mechanism when using only the vertical component of seismograms in the frequency range of 3-9 Hz. The application to dozens of induced seismic events showed satisfactory waveform matching between modelled and observed seismograms. The majority of the events have a strike direction parallel with the major NE-SW faults in the region. The normal faulting mechanism is dominant, which suggests the vertical stress is larger than the horizontal stress. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

In terms of ray theory, this phase consists of long‐period P, PP, S, SS, SP, PS, etc and its propagation mechanism is similar to that of a whispering gallery. In terms of normal‐mode theory, it represents a group of higher‐mode Rayleigh waves with a group velocity close to, but slower than, that of P wave. This phase has not been recognized as a distinct phase in the seismological practice because of clipping of seismograms for very large earthquakes. With the advent of modern wide‐dynamic range seismographs, this phase can be easily identified for all large earthquakes. In view of its use for identifying slow earthquakes, determining whether slow deformation is precursory or coseismic to the regular short‐period energy release, and determining velocity structures between the source and the station, we propose that this phase be called the “W phase”.

The reason is that Green's functions generated from flat-layered models are not correct for the complicated propagational phenomena associated with realistic crustal structure. The inversion is usually performed by removing short periods and inverting only selected portions of the records. This article, introduces a source estimation technique that allows for better use of the entire broadband record when only imperfect Green's functions are available. -from Authors},

abstract = {One important constraint on source retrieval from regional seismograms comes from the amplitude difference between various phases (such as Pnl/surface wave, SV/SH). Because the misfit errors used in some waveform inversions are normalized by the data and synthetics, the amplitude information in the data has not been fully utilized. In this article, we modify the "cut and paste" source estimation technique (Zhao and Helmberger, 1994) by removing this type of normalization. It is shown that the modified method increases the stability and resolution of inversion. When multiple stations at different distance ranges are used, a distance scaling factor is introduced to compensate for the amplitude decay with distance. By applying the technique to the TERRAscope data, we have determined source mechanisms and depths of 335 southern Californian events with ML ≧ 3.5. The amplitude decays with distance are r1.13 for Pnl, r0.55 for Love waves, and r0.74 for Rayleigh waves. In contrast to generally shallow source depths reported by the southern California short-period network, the depth distribution from waveform inversion shows a strong peak around 12 km with few earthquakes occurring above 5 km and below 20 km.},

We used waveforms recorded by the Italian National Seismic Network managed by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia and the CAT-SCAN (Calabria Apennine Tyrrhenian - Subduction Collision Accretion Network) project. We computed the moment tensor solutions using the Cut And Paste (CAP) method. The technique allows the determination of the source depth, moment magnitude and focal mechanisms using a grid search technique. For the earthquakes investigated, we tried different station distributions and different velocity models. Results were also checked by computing the moment tensor solutions using the SLUMT grid-search method. Both methods (CAP and SLUMT) allow time shifts between synthetic and observed data in order to reduce the dependence of the solution on the assumed velocity model and on earthquake location errors. Comparisons have been made with the available published solutions. The final focal mechanisms were robustly determined. We show that the application of the CAP and SLUMT methods can provide good-quality solutions in a magnitude range not properly represented in the Italian national earthquake catalogues, and where the solutions estimated from P-onset polarities are often poorly constrained. {\textcopyright} 2011 - OGS.},

abstract = {Source inversion of small-magnitude events such as aftershocks or mine collapses requires use of relatively high frequency seismic waveforms which are strongly affected by small-scale heterogeneities in the crust. In this study, we developed a new inversion method called gCAP3D for determining general moment tensor of a seismic source using Green's functions of 3D models. It inherits the advantageous features of the “Cut-and-Paste” (CAP) method to break a full seismogram into the Pnl and surface-wave segments and to allow time shift between observed and predicted waveforms. It uses grid search for 5 source parameters (relative strengths of the isotropic and compensated-linear-vector-dipole components and the strike, dip, and rake of the double-couple component) that minimize the waveform misfit. The scalar moment is estimated using the ratio of L2 norms of the data and synthetics. Focal depth can also be determined by repeating the inversion at different depths. We applied gCAP3D to the 2013 Ms 7.0 Lushan earthquake and its aftershocks using a 3D crustal-upper mantle velocity model derived from ambient noise tomography in the region. We first relocated the events using the double-difference method. We then used the finite-differences method and reciprocity principle to calculate Green's functions of the 3D model for 20 permanent broadband seismic stations within 200 km from the source region. We obtained moment tensors of the mainshock and 74 aftershocks ranging from Mw 5.2 to 3.4. The results show that the Lushan earthquake is a reverse faulting at a depth of 13–15 km on a plane dipping 40–47° to N46° W. Most of the aftershocks occurred off the main rupture plane and have similar focal mechanisms to the mainshock's, except in the proximity of the mainshock where the aftershocks' focal mechanisms display some variations.},

abstract = {Hutubi gas field, the largest gas storage field in China, has been operated on annual injection/extraction cycles since 9 June 2013. We study the seismicity near the gas field from 9 June 2013 to 22 October 2015, a time span that the gas field has experienced three injection periods and two extraction periods, and explore its physical mechanism based on the relationship between seismicity and field operation. We identify 273 events (ML > 1) in the region within 10 km of the gas field, with 97% of those occurring in the first two injection periods, 0.4% in the third injection period, and 1% in the two extraction periods. Seismicity in the first two injection periods occurs mostly as shallow clusters (focal depth < 2 km) at two locations: with one along the fault that marks the southern boundary of the gas field and the other about 2 km south to the southeastern tip of the gas field with the seismicity distributed along north-south direction. The seismicity does not correlate with total gas injection volume, injection rate, or well pressure. It instead occurs 11–17 hr after simultaneous abrupt increases/decreases of gas injection rate and well pressure in the field operation in the first two injection periods when some accumulative injection has reached. Such relationship is consistent with a physical mechanism that the seismicity near Hutubi gas field is induced on pore-pressured faults with a rate- and state-dependent friction law through an abrupt change of stress in elastic and undrained poroelastic responses to simultaneous abrupt changes of injection rate and well pressure. Our study also points to the possibility that induced seismicity may be controllable in some practical field operations.},

abstract = {On 17 June 2019, an ML 6.0 earthquake struck the Changning county in Sichuan Province of China, causing substantial casualties and property losses. The earthquake is the largest and the most damaging event in the Changning area and close to shale gas and salt mining production region. To investigate the possibility of the earthquake being induced, we resolve its rupture dimension and hypocentral depth via modeling of local seismic waveforms. The result reveals that its hypocentral depth is about 4 km, much shallower than most tectonic earthquake in surrounding regions. From moment tensor inversion (nodal plane 1 [NP1], strike 125°/dip 46°/rake 28°; NP2, strike 14°/dip 70°/rake 132°), the earthquake is found to be a strike-slip event with significant thrust component. We resolved rupture directivity via measuring the difference between centroid location and hypocenter location, and found that the causative fault is NP1 and ruptured northwestward with length about 14 km. Based on its shallow hypocentral depth, and proximity to nearby mining regions, we hypothesize that the Changning earthquake might be an induced event due to long-term fluid injection for salt mining. However, interdisciplinary studies are needed to test the hypothesis, including simulation of fluid migration and investigation of background stress as well as resolving mechanical parameters of the rocks in the epicentral regions.},

abstract = {Earthquake moment tensors and focal depths are crucial to assessing seismic hazards and studying active tectonic and volcanic processes. Although less powerful than strong earthquakes (M 7+), moderately strong earthquakes (M 5-6.5) occur more frequently and extensively, which can cause severe damages in populated areas. The inversion of moment tensors is usually affected by insufficient local waveform data (epicentral distance < 5°) in sparse seismic networks. It would be necessary to combine local and teleseismic data (epicentral distance 30°-90°) for a joint inversion. In this study, we present the generalized cut-and-paste joint (gCAPjoint) algorithm to jointly invert full moment tensor and centroid depth with local and teleseismic broadband waveforms. To demonstrate the effectiveness and explore the limitations of this algorithm, we perform case studies on three earthquakes with different tectonic settings and source properties. Comparison of our results with global centroid moment tensor and other catalog solutions illustrates that both non-double-couple compositions of the focal mechanisms and centroid depths can be reliably recovered for very shallow ( < 10 km) earthquakes and intermediate-depth events with this software package.},

abstract = {New satellite missions (e.g., the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 constellation), advances in data downlinking, and rapid product generation now provide us with the ability to access space-geodetic data within hours of their acquisition. To truly take advantage of this opportunity, we need to be able to interpret geodetic data in a prompt and robust manner. Here we present a Bayesian approach for the inversion of multiple geodetic data sets that allows a rapid characterization of posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of source model parameters. The inversion algorithm efficiently samples posterior PDFs through a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, with automatic step size selection. We apply our approach to synthetic geodetic data simulating deformation of magmatic origin and demonstrate its ability to retrieve known source parameters. We also apply the inversion algorithm to interferometric synthetic aperture radar data measuring co-seismic displacements for a thrust-faulting earthquake (2015 Mw 6.4 Pishan earthquake, China) and retrieve optimal source parameters and associated uncertainties. Given its robustness and rapidity in estimating deformation source parameters and uncertainties, our Bayesian framework is capable of taking advantage of real-time geodetic measurements. Thus, our approach can be applied to geodetic data to study magmatic, tectonic, and other geophysical processes, especially in rapid-response operational settings (e.g., volcano observatories). Our algorithm is fully implemented in a MATLAB{\textregistered}-based software package (Geodetic Bayesian Inversion Software) that we make freely available to the scientific community.},

The growing volume of freely available data coupled with ever expanding computational power opens avenues to tackle larger and more complex problems. Current bottlenecks include inefficient resource usage and insufficient data organization. Properly scaling a problem requires the resolution of both these challenges, and existing data formats are no longer up to the task. ASDF stores any number of synthetic, processed or unaltered waveforms in a single file. A key improvement compared to existing formats is the inclusion of comprehensive meta information, such as event or station information, in the same file. Additionally, it is also usable for any non-waveform data, for example, cross-correlations, adjoint sources or receiver functions. Last but not least, full provenance information can be stored alongside each item of data, thereby enhancing reproducibility and accountability. Any data set in our proposed format is self-describing and can be readily exchanged with others, facilitating collaboration. The utilization of the HDF5 container format grants efficient and parallel I/O operations, integrated compression algorithms and check sums to guard against data corruption. To not reinvent the wheel and to build upon past developments, we use existing standards like QuakeML, StationXML, W3C PROV and HDF5 wherever feasible. Usability and tool support are crucial for any new format to gain acceptance. We developed mature C/Fortran and Python based APIs coupling ASDF to the widely used SPECFEM3D_GLOBE and ObsPy toolkits.},

This is a sampling method guided by the local gradient information of the L2 norm misfit function. We employ the local gradient and the diagonal of the approximate Hessian information to construct a proposal distribution, which is a local Gaussian distribution. New samples/models can be easily drawn from the proposal distribution. The new samples/models are then subjected to the accept/reject Metropolis-Hasting (M-H) criterion. The solutions to FWI are then described by point-wise posterior PDFs. Uncertainties associated with FWI can be easily estimated by the PDFs. The proposed method can achieve the neighborhood of the target distribution with poor initial models. We term the proposed method a gradient based Markov chain Monte Carlo(GMCMC) method. We apply the proposed method to 2D Marmousi model with acoustic FWI. Even though the proposed method requires more computational effort than traditional FWI based on local optimization methods, numerical results suggest that the proposed method can provide a more reliable inversion results and statistical assessments to FWI.},

abstract = {A non-linear Bayesian Monte-Carlo method is presented to estimate a Vsv model beneath stations by jointly interpreting Rayleigh wave dispersion and receiver functions and associated uncertainties. The method is designed for automated application to large arrays of broad-band seismometers. As a testbed for the method, 185 stations from the USArray Transportable Array are used in the IntermountainWest, a region that is geologically diverse and structurally complex. Ambient noise and earthquake tomography are updated by applying eikonal and Helmholtz tomography, respectively, to construct Rayleighwave dispersionmaps from 8 to 80 s across the study region with attendant uncertainty estimates. Amethod referred to as 'harmonic stripping method' is described and applied as a basis for quality control and to generate backazimuth independent receiver functions for a horizontally layered, isotropic effective medium with uncertainty estimates for each station.A smooth parametrization between (as well as above and below) discontinuities at the base of the sediments and crust suffices to fit mostfeatures of both data types jointly across most of the study region. The effect of introducing receiver functions to surface wave dispersion data is quantified through improvements in the posterior marginal distribution of model variables. Assimilation of receiver functions quantitatively improves the accuracy of estimates of Moho depth, improves the determination of the Vsv contrast across Moho, and improves uppermost mantle structure because of the ability to relax a priori constraints. The method presented here is robust and can be applied systematically to construct a 3-D model of the crust and uppermost mantle across the large networks of seismometers that are developing globally, but also provides a framework for further refinements in the method. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2012.

@article{Duputel2012,
abstract = {Source inversion is a widely used practice in seismology. Magnitudes, moment tensors, slip distributions are now routinely calculated and disseminated whenever an earthquake occurs. The accuracy of such models depends on many aspects like the event magnitude, the data coverage and the data quality (instrument response, isolation, timing, etc.). Here, like in any observational problem, the error estimation should be part of the solution. It is however very rare to find a source inversion algorithm which includes realistic error analyses, and the solutions are often given without any estimates of uncertainties. Our goal here is to stress the importance of such estimation and to explore different techniques aimed at achieving such analyses. In this perspective, we use the W phase source inversion algorithm recently developed to provide fast CMT estimations for large earthquakes. We focus in particular on the linear-inverse problem of estimating the moment tensor components at a given source location. We assume that the initial probability densities can be modelled by Gaussian distributions. Formally, we can separate two sources of error which generally contribute to the model parameter uncertainties. The first source of uncertainty is the error introduced by the more or less imperfect data. This is carried by the covariance matrix for the data (C d). The second source of uncertainty, often overlooked, is associated with modelling error or mismodelling. This is represented by the covariance matrix on the theory, C T. Among the different sources of mismodelling, we focus here on the modelling error associated with the mislocation of the centroid position. Both C d and C T describe probability densities in the data space and it is well known that it is in fact C D=C d+C T that should be included into the error propagation process. In source inversion problems, like in many other fields of geophysics, the data covariance (C D) is often considered as diagonal or even proportional to the identity matrix. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of using a more realistic form for C D. If we incorporate accurate covariance components during the inversion process, it refines the posterior error estimates but also improves the solution itself. We discuss these issues using several synthetic tests and by applying the W phase source inversion algorithm to several large earthquakes such as the recent 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {We introduce a new algorithm for joint inversion of body wave and surface wave data to get better 3-D P wave (Vp) and S wave (Vs) velocity models by taking advantage of the complementary strengths of each data set. Our joint inversion algorithm uses a one-step inversion of surface wave traveltime measurements at different periods for 3-D Vs and Vp models without constructing the intermediate phase or group velocity maps. This allows a more straightforward modeling of surface wave traveltime data with the body wave arrival times. We take into consideration the sensitivity of surface wave data with respect to Vp in addition to its large sensitivity to Vs, which means both models are constrained by two different data types. The method is applied to determine 3-D crustal Vp and Vs models using body wave and Rayleigh wave data in the Southern California plate boundary region, which has previously been studied with both double-difference tomography method using body wave arrival times and ambient noise tomography method with Rayleigh and Love wave group velocity dispersion measurements. Our approach creates self-consistent and unique models with no prominent gaps, with Rayleigh wave data resolving shallow and large-scale features and body wave data constraining relatively deeper structures where their ray coverage is good. The velocity model from the joint inversion is consistent with local geological structures and produces better fits to observed seismic waveforms than the current Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) model.},

This paper is concerned with a two-dimensional graphical display of all possible relative sizes of the three principal moments; it provides a method of representing the probability density of these relative sizes deduced from a given set of data. Information provided by such a display, together with that relating to the orientation of the principal moments, provides as full a picture of the moment tensor as possible apart from an indication of its absolute magnitude. Although we have in mind the study of teleseismic relative amplitude data, the ideas can, in principle, be applied quite generally. The aim is to be able to display the degree of constraint imposed on the moment tensor by any set of observed data; estimates of the sizes of the principal moments together with their errors, when displayed on the source type plot, show directly the range of moment tensors compatible with the data. -from Authors},

abstract = {Southwest China, located at the southeastern margin of the Tibetan plateau, plays an important role for the plateau growth and its material extrusion. It has complicated tectonic environment and strong seismic activities including the 2008 Wenchuan great earthquake. Numerous geophysical studies have been conducted in southwest China. However, a community velocity model (CVM) in this region is still not available, which makes it difficult to have a consistent catalog of earthquake locations and focal mechanisms and a consistent velocity model for simulating strong ground motions and evaluating earthquake hazards. In this study, we aim at building a high-resolution CVM (both VP and VS) of the crust and uppermost mantle in southwest China along with earthquake locations by joint inversion of body- and surface-wave travel-time data. In total, we have assembled 386,958 P- and 372,662 S-wave first arrival times and nearly 8100 Rayleigh-wave dispersion curves in the period band of 5–50 s. A multigrid strategy is adopted in the joint inversion. A coarser horizontal grid interval of 0.5° is first used and then a finer grid interval of 0.25° is used with initial models interpolated from the coarser-grid inverted velocity models. The spatial resolution of both VP and VS models can reach up to 0.5° horizontally and 10 km vertically according to the checkerboard tests. The comparisons of our inverted VP and VS models with those from other studies show general consistency in large-scale features. The inverted models are further validated by P-wave arrival times from active sources and Rayleigh-wave data. In general, our velocity models show two low-velocity zones in the middle-lower crust and a prominent high-velocity region in between them. Our new models have been served as the first version of the CVM in southwest China (SWChinaCVM-1.0) for future studies.},

abstract = {In this paper, we relocated the MS6.4 Yangbi earthquake sequence in Yunnan province by the "multi-stage" method and the phase arrival data from the Yunnan regional seismic network. The focal mechanism solutions of 13 MS≥4.0 events were calculated by the CAP program. We found that the sequence is about 3$\sim$10 km away from the nearest known Weixi-Qiaohou fault, and the long-axis of the aftershock events is about 22 km striking NW-SE, with its dominant focal depth is 4$\sim$8 km, reflecting the Yangbi earthquake occurred in the shallow part of the upper Crust. Earthquakes along the northern segment of the aftershock area are relatively shallow and dense, while along the southern segment earthquakes are deeper and more dispersed and deflected to the south. Different short-axis cross-sections reveal that the seismogenic structure is dipping towards SW with a gentler angle for the SE segment and steeper angle for the NW segment. We identified two small-scale NE-striking conjugate faults (about 5 km long) in the northern part of the sequence. The foreshocks on May 18 propagated gradually from the center towards NW where the mainshock is located. Since the foreshock sequences were dense and triggered by each other, we thus concluded a cascade mode of the foreshock occurrence. The main shock was located in the NW end of the aftershock intensive area, which indicated that it had the characteristics of SE-trending unilateral rupture. The focal mechanism solutions of most MS≥4.0 events have NW-SE striking steep nodal planes, consistent with the long axis of the aftershock distribution. The stress inversion results revealed that the seismogenic structure is affected by the NNW-SSE striking nearly horizontal principal compressive stress, which is consistent with the fault occurrence and dislocation type of the adjacent Weixi-Qiaohou fault. It can be preliminarily determined that the seismogenic structure is a parallel secondary structure of Weixi-Qiaohou fault. The formation of this structure may be related to the SE escape of the active Sichuan-Yunnan block and the clockwise rotation of Southwest Yunnan block.},

The earthquake shows almost pure strike-slip focal mechanism, but it is still uncertain which nodal plane (NP) is the ruptured fault plane. To resolve the fault plane, we determine rupture directivity of the earthquake via the relative centroid method. We begin with inverting the point-source solution (strike 297°/dip 84°/rake 1° for NP1, strike 206°/dip 89°/rake 173° for NP2, and centroid depth 16 km) and then determine the relative location between the centroid and hypocenter via regional waveform fitting. Two M 4+ aftershocks are used as reference events, and the waveform time shifts of reference events with respect to the 1D velocity model are used to calibrate the path effects. The results show that the Illinois mainshock ruptured to east-southeast along the 297° NP for about 2–3km, consistent with relocated aftershock distribution, and we infer that the sinistral causative fault connects the north-northwest-trending La Salle anticlinal belt and the north-northeast-trending WVFS.},

@article{Fang2019,
abstract = {Ill-posed seismic inverse problems are often solved using Tikhonov-type regularization, that is, incorporation of damping and smoothing to obtain stable results. This typically results in overly smooth models, poor amplitude resolution, and a difficult choice between plausible models. Recognizing that the average of parameters can be better constrained than individual parameters, we propose a seismic tomography method that stabilizes the inverse problem by projecting the original high-dimension model space onto random low-dimension subspaces and then infers the high-dimensional solution from combinations of such subspaces. The subspaces are formed by functions constant in Poisson Voronoi cells, which can be viewed as the mean of parameters near a certain location. The low-dimensional problems are better constrained, and image reconstruction of the subspaces does not require explicit regularization. Moreover, the low-dimension subspaces can be recovered by subsets of the whole dataset, which increases efficiency and offers opportunities to mitigate uneven sampling of the model space. The final (high-dimension) model is then obtained from the low-dimension images in different subspaces either by solving another normal equation or simply by averaging the low-dimension images. Importantly, model uncertainty can be obtained directly from images in different subspaces. Synthetic tests show that our method outperforms conventional methods both in terms of geometry and amplitude recovery. The application to southern California plate boundary region also validates the robustness of our method by imaging geologically consistent features as well as strong along-strike variations of San Jacinto fault that are not clearly seen using conventional methods.},

This equivalent force depends only upon the source and the elastic properties of the medium in the immediate vicinity of the source and not upon the proximity of any reflecting surfaces. The theory is developed for dislocations in an anisotropic inhomogeneous medium; in the examples isotropy is assumed. For displacement dislocation faults, the double couple is an exact equivalent body force.}",

The vector field is the equivalent force. The tensor fields are the stress-free strain, the stress glut, and any other moment tensor density. A particular source uniquely determines all of its descriptions except the moment tensor densities, but the motion it produces determines only the equivalent force. The source can also be described by the polynomial moments of any of its four field descriptions, and for small sources exciting long waves, a good approximate description is obtained from a finite number of low-degree moments of the equivalent force or the stress glut. ‘The’ seismic moment tensor is the zeroth degree moment tensor of the stress glut or any moment tensor density and also the first degree moment tensor of the equivalent force. The n'th degree moments of any moment tensor density are uniquely determined by the motion if n =  0, 1 but not if n ⩾ 2. In the Earth, the stress drop is not a moment tensor density, and its volume integral is not ‘the’ seismic moment tensor. In a later paper these conclusions are shown to be unaffected by relaxing the assumption of a continuous displacement field.}",

In our earlier paper the displacement field s was supposed to be continuously differentiable, so discontinuous faulting could not be discussed. The present work extends our earlier paper to cover the possibility that  is a singular generalized function, so that s can be discontinuous or singular. Even when s is smooth, generalized functions simplify the notation. Surface and volume forces, real or equivalent, can be combined in a single distribution; boundary conditions are automatically included in the field equations; and representing a localized source by certain moment tensors of low degree amounts to approximating the source by a point source with the same moments of low degree. It is shown that all the results in our earlier paper can be extended to discontinuous s and singular . New results, not obtainable in our earlier paper, include these: a simple description of the most general seismic point source; a proof that every tensor with the obvious appropriate index symmetries is a forcemoment or glut-moment tensor of a seismic point source; a catalogue of point sources with no seismic effects; a new, direct derivation of the classical phenomenological descriptions of ideal fault sources which Burridge \\&amp; Knopoff, Dahlen and Walton obtained from the reciprocity theorem and the impulse response; a discussion of how, unlike ideal faults, a real fault might have a seismic moment tensor with non-zero trace; and a description of a source type, the simple surface source, which may be a more accurate phenomenological description of real faults than are the classical ideal fault descriptions. It can be shown that a simple surface source with fault surface Σ is uniquely determined by the motion it produces if it is developable or if the Gaussian curvature of Σ never vanishes, but not if Σ contains a piece of a plane.}",
